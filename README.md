# Sorting Simulator in C++

## Overview
This project is a console-based Sorting Simulator developed in C++. It allows users to input data, visualize the sorting process using various algorithms, and compare performance through time analysis.

## Features
- Input custom number of elements
- Choose between:
  - Single sorting algorithm simulation
  - Side-by-side comparison of two algorithms
- Sorting algorithms included:
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
- Time measurement for performance comparison
- Sorting history storage for reference

## How to Run (Visual Studio)
1. Open Microsoft Visual Studio
2. Create a new **Console App** project in C++
3. Paste the code into `main.cpp`
4. Build and run using `Ctrl + F5`

> Note: This project is designed to run in Visual Studio and may not work correctly in VS Code.

## Summary
The Sorting Simulator is an educational tool aimed at helping users understand and compare sorting algorithms. Itâ€™s ideal for students and learners exploring algorithm efficiency in practice.
